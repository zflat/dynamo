# Plugin Definition file
# The purpose of this file is to declare to InSpec what plugin_types (capabilities)
# are included in this plugin, and provide activator that will load them as needed.

# It is important that this file load successfully and *quickly*.
# Your plugin's functionality may never be used on this InSpec run; so we keep things
# fast and light by only loading heavy things when they are needed.

# Presumably this is light
require "<%= plugin_name %>/version"

# The InspecPlugins namespace is where all plugins should declare themselves.
# The "Inspec" capitalization is used throughout the InSpec source code; yes, it's
# strange.

  # would be the CamelCase version of your plugin gem name.

    #   Dynamo.plugin returns various Classes, intended to be superclasses for various
    # plugin components. Here, the one-arg form gives you the Plugin Definition superclass,
    # which mainly gives you access to the activator / plugin_type DSL.
    #   The number '2' says you are asking for version 2 of the plugin API. If there are
    # future versions, Dynamo promises plugin API v2 will work for at least two more Dynamo
    # major versions.
