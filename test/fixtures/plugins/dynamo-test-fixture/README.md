This directory is the source code for the RubyGem dynamo-test-fixture, which is published on rubygems.org for testing.

In version 0.1.0, it has no dependencies.
In version 0.2.0, it depends on ordinal_array.

In both versions, it implements a mock_plugin, whose execute() method checks to see if Array responds to :third.
